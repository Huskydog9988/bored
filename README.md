# Bored

This is a repo contains projects I undertake whenever I get bored. These projects range from implementing algos to designing useless software.

## Projects

To find any given project it's a fairly simple ordeal. First, just simply choose your preferred language and enter its folder. 
Lastly, just scroll through said folder till you find the project you where looking for. 
Each folder is aptly named so finding what you're looking for shouldn't be too difficult.
